# 100-days-of-coding
Welcome to my 100-days-of-coding repository! This repository contains the projects and exercises that I have completed during my 100-day coding challenge.

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to improve my coding skills and knowledge in various programming languages and technologies. Throughout the 100 days, I will be working on a wide range of projects, from simple scripts to more complex applications. By the end of the challenge, I will have a diverse portfolio of projects that showcase my progress and development as a programmer.

## Goals

My goals for this challenge are as follows:

- Improve my coding skills in languages such as C++, Java, Python, JavaScript.
- Learn new technologies and frameworks such as React, Node.js, and SQL.
- Develop a strong understanding of data structures and algorithms
- Learn about web development and build a web application
- Develop my problem-solving and debugging skills.
- Learn about version control using Git and GitHub.

## Progress

I will be updating this repository daily with my progress and the projects that I have completed. Each project will include detailed documentation and comments to explain the code and my thought process.

## Conclusion

I am excited to embark on this 100-day coding journey and I look forward to growing.
